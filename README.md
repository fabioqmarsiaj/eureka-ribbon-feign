  ## Introduction
  
   We have three microservices made with spring boot: app-service, playlist-service and song-service.
   
   The song-service has a database implemented with mongoDB, and contain an ID and TITLE.
   
   The playlist-service is also implemented with mongoDB and contain an ID and a LIST of songs ID's.
   
   Passing through parameter a playlist id to the app-service, one should get all details about the songs inside the playlist.
   
   Those are the application steps:
   - The app-service makes a GET request to the playlist-service with a playlist ID as parameter;
   - The playlist-service returns all songs inside that specific playlist;
   - Now, with all song ids, app-service makes a GET request to the song-service which returns all song details.
